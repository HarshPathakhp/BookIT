Social informatics is an interdisciplinary field of research dedicated to studying the design, use and effects of information technologies. Social informatics seeks to understand how social contexts shape the form and character of technology. Likewise it also studies how technology influences power relationships and restructures social and organizational networks. In this course we will be developing our understanding of these issues by engaging critically with various controversial topics relating to information and communication technologies. This course urges students to go beyond the “merely technical” aspects of ICTs and consider the social relations that are an integral part of designing and adopting a technology or a technological system. It also challenges students to think critically about technological change and acquire a more sophisticated understanding of the process.
