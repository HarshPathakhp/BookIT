Write program in assembly language(RISC ISA) - Compare performance between several implementations of a computer program.
Analyse processor performance for different implementation strategies : eg. single vs. multicycle,pipelined vs. non-pipelined execution.
Simulate and compare performance of cache memory,compare caches with different configuration.
Analyse basic I/O operation and their performance.
