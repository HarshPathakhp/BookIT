2: Able to work with vector fields, evaluate line and surface integrals, calculate quantities such as work, circulation and flux across plane curves and surfaces, be able to carry out vector derivative operations such as gradient, divergence and curl and understand and apply Green's, Stoke's and divergence  theorems.
3: Able to evaluate derivatives and integrals of complex functions, including the applications of Cauchy’s theorem.
4: Able to determine convergence of complex series and power series and understand and apply Taylor series to represent complex functions.
