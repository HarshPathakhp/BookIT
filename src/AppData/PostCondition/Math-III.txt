Students are able to apply concepts of continuity, differentiability, extrema and integrability of multivariable functions and evaluate various integrals (line, double, triple and surface integrals).Students are able to work with vector fields, evaluate line
and surface integrals, calculate quantities such as work,circulation and flux across plane curves and surfaces, be able to carry out vector derivative operations such as gradient, divergence and curl and understand and apply Green's, Stoke's and divergence  theorems.Students are able to evaluate
derivatives and integrals of complex functions, including the applications of Cauchy’s theorem.Students are able to determine convergence of complex series and power series and understand and apply Taylor series to represent complex
functions.
